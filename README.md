## üìú Abstract
This research introduces a novel **compressive domain analytics framework** leveraging **deep learning** to enable efficient seismic image analysis. The framework optimizes for:
- **Fault line detection**
- **Salt trace identification**

By utilizing **low bits per pixel**, the model ensures effective transmission in bandwidth-constrained scenarios, achieving high **PSNR** and **SSIM** metrics.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features
- **High Compression Efficiency**: Improved seismic data transmission.
- **Accurate Fault Detection**: Enhanced performance in geophysical analysis.
- **Low Resource Requirement**: Optimized for compressive domains.
